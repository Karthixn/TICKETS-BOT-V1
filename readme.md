## ✨ Features

### 🏗️ Core System
- **Dynamic Ticket Creation** — Category-based channels for Support, FRP, and HoodFRP.
- **Embed-based Interface** — All user interactions use rich, branded embeds.
- **Modular Structure** — Commands, handlers, and utils separated for clean maintenance.

### 🎟️ Ticket Management
- **Interactive Ticket Panel**
  - 🛡️ Support  
  - 🎮 FRP Inquiry *(uses modal form)*  
  - 🏘️ HoodFRP Inquiry *(uses modal form)*  
- **Modal Forms** collect user data upfront (In-Game Name, Issue Type, Details).
- **Automatic Channel Creation** in correct categories (private to staff + user).

### 🧰 Staff Controls
Inside each ticket, staff get a control panel with:
- 🙋 **Claim Ticket** — Marks ownership by staff member.
- 👤 **Add User** — Add extra user IDs to ticket visibility.
- 🔒 **Close Ticket** — Closes the ticket, sends transcript to staff log, DMs user a copy, and deletes channel after delay.

### 🕒 Automation
- **Auto Inactivity Closure**
  - Warns after 48 hours of no activity.
  - Closes automatically after 49 hours total.
- **Auto Logging & Transcript Archiving** in a designated log channel.

### ⭐ Rating & Feedback
- After closure, users receive a DM asking to rate their experience (1–5 stars).
- Ratings are logged to the staff log channel and tracked internally.

### 📊 Staff Dashboard
Command `/staffstats` displays:
- Total open tickets
- Average wait time
- Staff leaderboard by closed tickets

### 🛡️ Branding
All embeds include a **consistent footer**:

```
